### Operations Research II (Continuous Assignment â€“ 01)

A logistics company located at Node 01 has to distribute goods to other nodes (Node 02, Node 03, ..., Node 31). The locations of nodes are given in (x, y) coordinates in the following table. The capacity of a truck is 90 MT.

You are required to perform the following tasks:

a) Declare decision variables, parameters, and indices. (10 marks)

b) Construct the distance matrix. (10 marks)

c) Formulate the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. (30 marks)

d) Find solutions using MS Excel Solver or any solver available in Python. (40 marks)

e) Discuss the assumptions that you made and the implications of the answer(s) you found in the above. (10 marks)
